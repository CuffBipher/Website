        <a href="../index.html#bigfoot">BigFoot</a>
        <p>The Bigfoot is perhaps the strongest cryptid among the chosen, boasting an incredible 20 strength. It also wins most mental matchups with the other cryptids. Overall the Bigfoot has a pretty simplistic win plan, defense. Having high damage, but low dexterity means this thing is built like a tank.
        The bigfoot's long reaching limbs give it a particular advantage against smaller enemies. As a grappler, the Bigfoot can play patiently and try to go for grabs to deal extra damage to it's opponents.

        <a href="../index.html#wendigo">Wendigo</a>
        <p>The Wendigo takes second place, it has superior dexterity to the Bigfoot, similar strength, but it's mind is completely eroded. The Bigfoot's slow movements would throw off the quick sudden movements of the Wendigo.</p>

        <a href="../index.html#lochness">Loch Ness Monster</a>
        <p>The Loch Ness Monster is for sure a force to be reckoned with in the water, however, it is entirely confined to the Loch Ness and not much of a threat outside of that. Theoretically it could beach itself to cause damage to creatures at the shoreline, but the risk reward is too skewed out of it's favour that it isn't likely to try this in an actual match. It has an advantage in neutral, but it's combo game leaves a lot to be desired.</p>

      <li>
        <a href="../index.html#mothman">Mothman</a>
        <p>The Mothman uses a dex build, but lacks the strength needed to actually deal any damage to the tiers above it. The Mothman adopts a rushdown playstyle to keep the opponent guessing in neutral, however upon losing neutral, there's not much it can do to come back.</p>

      <li>
        <a href="../index.html#chupacabra">Chupacabra</a>
        <p>The Chupacabra also runs a rushdown build, however, it's mental stats are shot on account of it's feral nature, making the Chupacabra tonights biggest loser.</p>
