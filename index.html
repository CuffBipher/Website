                <p>Bigfoot are a species of apelike creatures that walk upright, like humans, but are far larger and more reclusive, leading to their scarce sightings.</p>

                <h3>Stats:</h3>

                <p>(Note, stats are numbered so that 10 = the human average.)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>STRength: 20</h4>
                        <p>20 strength is incredibly high, this creature is not to be trifled with, long range will be your best bet if the creature picks a fight with you.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>DEXterity: 8</h4>
                        <p>Many sightings of Bigfoot claim it to be a lumbering tower. Walking without much grace, or speed. Likely has diminished reflexes, although, try to avoid trees, as a descendent of apes, the Bigfoot likely has enhanced climbing prowess.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>CHArisma: 8</h4>
                        <p>Out of sight, out of mind. Bigfoot, as far as we know, are not likely to make contact with other species, their nature among peers has yet to be studied.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>WISdom: 16</h4>
                        <p>Spending the entirety of it's life in the woods, it has become accustomed to nature, and may have learned druidic spells.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>INTellect: 10</h4>
                        <p>This creature may or may not know much, but considering it avoids us, I'd like to think it might be a little more intelligent than current knowledge tends to suggest.</p>
