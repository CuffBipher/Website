                <h2><li>Bigfoot</li></h2>
                <p>Bigfoot is a species of apelike creatures that walk upright, like humans, but are far larger and more reclusive, leading to their scarce sightings.</p>

                    <h3>Stats:</h3>
                    <li>
                        <h4>STRength: 20</h4>
                        <p>20 strength is incredibly high, this creature is not to be trifled with, long range will be your best bet if the creature picks a fight with you.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>DEXterity: 8</h4>
                        <p>Many sightings of Bigfoot claim it to be a lumbering tower. Walking without much grace, or speed. Likely has diminished reflexes, although, try to avoid trees, as a descendent of apes, the Bigfoot likely has enhanced climbing prowess.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>CHArisma: 8</h4>
                        <p>Out of sight, out of mind. Bigfoots as far as we know are not likely to make contact with other species, it is not known their true nature amongst each other.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>WISdom: 16</h4>
                        <p>Spending the entirety of it's life in the woods, it has become accustomed to nature, and may know druidic spells. Like invisibility.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>INTellect: 10</h4>
                        <p>This creature may or may not know much, but considering it avoids us, I'd like to think it might be a little more intelligent than current knowledge shows.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
